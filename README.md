**# 🚗 Vehicle Detection & Counting using YOLO + OpenCV

A real-time computer vision system for detecting, classifying, tracking, and counting vehicles in video streams using YOLO object detection and OpenCV. This project is intended for traffic monitoring, smart city analytics, and intelligent transportation systems.

---

## 📌 Overview

This system performs:
- Real-time vehicle detection  
- Vehicle classification (car, bus, truck, motorbike)  
- Persistent object ID tracking  
- Line-based directional vehicle counting  
- On-screen visual overlays  
- Output video recording (`output.mp4`)  



---

## ✨ Key Features

- YOLO-based detection (Ultralytics YOLOv8n)
- GPU or CPU execution
- Real-time optimized
- Centroid-based vehicle tracking
- Counting logic using boundary crossing
- Input flexibility (video file or webcam)
- Results saved as annotated output video
